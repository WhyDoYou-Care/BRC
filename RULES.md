# Rules: 50 Shades of Segfault

## Technical Requirements
- Only standard Python libraries are allowed. Precompiled binaries, non-standard libraries, and external APIs are prohibited.
- Code must be original and created during the contest timeframe.
- All code submissions must adhere to the specified input/output format.
- Solutions must execute within the allocated time and memory constraints.
- Modify only `main.py` inside the `src/` folder. Do not create files outside the `src/` folder.

## Code of Conduct
- Any form of plagiarism will result in immediate disqualification.
- Any attempt at malpractice will result in immediate disqualification.
- Any attempt at tampering with the judging platform or contest infrastructure will result in immediate disqualification.
- Participants are responsible for staying updated on any rule changes announced during the competition.

## Contest Protocol
- Participants must submit solutions within the specified deadlines.
- All submissions will be evaluated using the provided test cases and additional hidden test cases.
- The decision of the judges will be final and binding in all matters.
- The organizers reserve the right to disqualify any participant at any point of the contest.

## Execution Time Limits & Rules
- Maximum execution time: 40 seconds.
- If your code takes more than 40 seconds, it will be terminated and marked as failed.
- Push tests run with `LEVEL=5` (for your reference).
- Upgrade tests run with `LEVEL=15` (used for the leaderboard).

## Winning Criteria
- The fastest valid execution on `LEVEL=15` determines the winner.
- Only Python standard libraries are allowed.
- No precompiled binaries, no external dependencies, no API calls unless explicitly allowed.

## Additional Notes
- In case of technical issues, contact the organizers immediately through the designated channels.
- Solutions will be judged on correctness, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.
